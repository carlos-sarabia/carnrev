#### This repository contains the datasets and analysis scripts used in Sarabia et al. (2025), "Trophic niche overlap decreases in related mesocarnivore species", published in Oikos. The repository is organized into three folders:

**- phylogenetic_dist:** Contains the extrapolation of phylogenetic distances from cytochrome b data to mitochondrial distances in carnivores. Includes pairwise distance tables and Python scripts testing regression models and regression trees.

**- pianka:** Includes the compiled dietary dataset from all reviewed studies, a Python script to calculate Pianka’s niche overlap coefficients, and the resulting pairwise comparisons across species, ecoregions, and biomes.

**- GLM:** Contains the extended analytical dataset integrating phylogenetic, ecological, and abiotic variables, along with the R scripts used to run Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) testing the relationship between Pianka’s overlap coefficients and explanatory variables.
