#### This repository contains the extrapolation of phylogenetic distances from cytochrome B data to mitochondrial distances in carnivores. Files included:

**1.cytb_v_mito.Geffen_1995.Hassanin_2021.md** - A markdown document that details the extrapolation of cytochrome-B and mitochondrial phylogenetic distances between carnivores, extracted from Geffen et al. (1996) "Size, Life-History Traits, and Social Organization in the Canidae: A Reevaluation" (cyt-B distances) and Hassanin et al. (2021) "Evolutionary history of Carnivora (Mammalia, Laurasiatheria) inferred from mitochondrial genomes" (mitochondrial DNA distances)

**table_comp.cytb.mito.csv** - A composed table with 92 pairwise phylogenetic distances from both publications

**2.regression.lines.py** - A python script that explores several regression models between both phylogenetic distance tables. 

**2.regression.trees.py** - A python script that explores several regression trees between both phylogenetic distance tables.
